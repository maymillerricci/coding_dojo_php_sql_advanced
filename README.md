CS201 Assignments - PHP and SQL Advanced

Weeks 3-4 - 10/23/13-10/30/13

Basic Email Form:
Make a basic form that checks if an email address is valid and if so adds it to a SQL database.

Basic Ninja Game:
Create a "game" where a ninja can enter a farm, cave, house, or casino and earn or lose gold at each place.  Keep a running log of the activities below, and have the option to allow the user to reset the game.

Intermediate Register Login:
Create registration and login forms and connect them with a users SQL database.  The registration should validate that each field's entry is in a valid format, and the login should validate that the user is in the database and that the password is correct.  Both forms should display the appropriate error messages if any field is invalid.

Advanced Wall:
Add to the registration/login a "wall" of messages and comments.  If a user is logged in, they can post a message or leave a comment to an existing message.  For this assignment, I redid the formatting for my registration and login using Bootstrap and used Bootstrap for the wall as well.  We also updated the input fields to prevent SQL injection.
